\begin{equation}
\Delta_3 x = | \Delta_3 \x| = R_E^2 \frac{R_p^2}{r^3} (1 - \beta)^2. 
\end{equation}
Note that $r$ here is the unlensed distance in the redshift plane of the perturber. To convert to offset as observed on the sky $r'$, we use the lens equation to yield $r' = r - \beta R_E$. As the perturbing galaxy is many Einstein radii away from the lens\footnote{If this is not the case, both galaxies need to be treated exactly as main lens planes, not as perturbers.}, $r' \approx r$. We will use $\Delta_3 x$ to characterize the strength of the third order terms in our simulations below.
