To test these expectations based on the Taylor Series expansion, we ran numerical simulations with an SIE main lens galaxy and a single perturber galaxy of varying masses. We choose the Einstein radius of the main lens to be $R_E = 1.0''$,  the lens and perturber redshift $z_{\rm{lens}} = z_p = 0.3$, and a source redshift $z_{\rm{src}} = 2.0$. The results of these simulations are shown in Figure \ref{fig:toyr3}.
