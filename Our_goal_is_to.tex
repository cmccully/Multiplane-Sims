Our next goal is to use $\Delta_3x$ to decide which galaxies to include exactly and which to include using the tidal approximation. We want to find the sweet spot that speeds up the modeling without introducing systematic uncertainties that are larger than the measurement uncertainties.
Figure \ref{fig:RXJ1131} shows the recovered lens parameters for RXJ1131 as a function of cutoff in $\Delta_3x$. The galaxies are shown in the histograms in the bottom of the panels. Any galaxy to the left of a given point is treated exactly, while galaxies to the right are treated in the tidal approximation. The error bars mark the $16^{th}$ and $84^{th}$ percentiles of the posterior distribution of fitted parameters. We again use the MCMC method to marginalize over the fitted parameters, so the distribution of recovered lens properties is the marginalized, one dimensional posterior distribution.
