In all of these models, the $\chi^2$ increases as the perturber gets closer to the main galaxy and the higher order terms become more important. Both the $\chi^2$ and the scatter approximately follow a power law. For the None models, the $\chi^2$ and the scatter follow power laws of $r^{-4}$ and $r^{-2}$, respectively. The None models ignore the perturber entirely, we are not even taking into account the shear that goes as $1/r^2$ consistent with the power law slope we find. The $\chi^2$ goes as the square of the residuals which also agrees with the $r^{-4}$ power law. For the Shear and LOS models, we do take into account the shear terms, but ignore third order (flexion) terms and higher. As such, $\chi^2 \propto r^{-6}$ and the scatter $\propto r^{-3}$ for the LOS and Shear models.
