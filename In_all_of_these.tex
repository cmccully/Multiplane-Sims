In all of these models, the $\chi^2$ increases as the perturber gets closer to the main galaxy and the higher order terms become more important. Both the $\chi^2$ and the scatter in the parameters approximately follow a power law. For the Lens-Only models, the $\chi^2$ and the scatter follow power laws of $r^{-4}$ and $r^{-2}$, respectively. The Lens-Only models ignore the perturber entirely, not taking into account the shear term that goes as $1/r^2$, consistent with the power law index of the residuals. The $\chi^2$ goes as the square of the residuals which also agrees with the $r^{-4}$ power law. For the Lens+Shear and 3-D Lens models we do take into account the shear terms, but ignore third order (flexion) terms and higher. As such, $\chi^2 \propto r^{-6}$ and the scatter $\propto r^{-3}$ for the 3-D Lens and Lens+Shear models.
