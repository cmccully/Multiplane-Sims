Our goal here is to answer two main questions: when does the shear approximation break down (i.e., when are the higher order terms in the potential non-negligible?) and when are the non-linear effects in the lens equation significant?
To begin, we examine the recovered lens model parameters to the perturbations in the image positions characterized by $\Delta_3 x$.
