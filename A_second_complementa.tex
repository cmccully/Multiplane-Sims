An alternate approach to adding an external convergence in post-processing, is to build full, 3-D mass models of the environment/LOS.  We now have an extensive photometric and spectroscopic dataset on $\sim25$ strong lensing systems \citep{Momcheva06,Williams08, Wong11, Momcheva15}. Following the methodology of \citet{Wong11}, we can build beam models that include all of the observed mass along the LOS, in a self consistent way.  While our approach is more complicated and observationally expensive, our models have a direct connection between the convergence in the lens models and the physical mass in the beam. Using the multi-plane framework we developed in \citet{McCully14} (hereafter M14), we can compare the recovered lens parameters from the method that fits an external shear (hereafter, the Shear Method). This framework gives us the tools necessary to decide which perturbing galaxies are the most important, to compare between different strong lens fields, and to predict which image configurations produce the strongest constraints on the Hubble Constant.
