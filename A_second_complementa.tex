A second, complementary approach to adding an external convergence in post-processing, is to build 3-D mass models of the environment/LOS.  We now have an extensive photometric and spectroscopic dataset on $\sim25$ strong lensing systems \citep{Momcheva06,Williams08, Wong11}. Following the methodology of \citet{Wong11}, we can build beam models that include all of the observed mass along the LOS.  While our approach is more complicated and observationally expensive, our models have a direct connection between the convergence in the lens models and the physical mass in the beam. \citet{Wong11} also find that the external shear from the fit does not always match the shear calculated from modeling the environment/LOS directly.
