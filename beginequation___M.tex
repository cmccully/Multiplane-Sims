\begin{equation}
  M = \pi D_\ell^2 \theta^2 \rho_p\ dr_p

where we switch notation from $r_a$ to $D_\ell$ because that is the relevant angular diameter distance, but keep $dr_p$ to remind us that we are talking about the thickness in terms of proper distance.  The mass produces a deflection given as
