While it is common to put priors on the lens galaxy position, ellipticity, and orientation based on the light profile \citep[e.g.][]{Bolton08}, we do not implement these priors in our analysis. We assume a Gaussian prior on the Hubble Constant, $h = 0.71 \pm 0.3$, to make sure that the models are reasonable, but not strong enough to drive the results. Because doubles have fewer constraints than free parameters, the priors on the models can play a stronger role in the fits. While the results from the fits from the double and quad image configurations are quantitatively different, they are qualitatively similar. Therefore, throughout our analysis we will focus on the results for quad image configurations as they are better constrained.  
The models with a single perturbing galaxy are summarized in Table \ref{tab:models}
