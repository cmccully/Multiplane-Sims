As discussed above, we expect that the mass of the perturbing galaxy, its projected offset from the main lens, and its redshift will affect its contribution to the higher order terms. If the strongest constraints on $\chi^2$ are from the image positions (as they often are), we might expect the $\chi^2$ and scatter in the fitted parameters to follow the perturbations in the image positions ($\Delta_3 x$). We begin by isolating the dependence on projected offset and mass. Figure \ref{masscompare} shows the $\chi^2$ of the fits and the recovered values for the Hubble Constant, $h$, and the galaxy halo ellipticity, $e$, for a point mass perturber in the lens plane ($z_{\rm pert} = 0.3$) for the LOS, Shear, and None models described in Section \ref{sec:setup}.
