We can consider voids as the sum of negative mass planes relative to the mean density of the universe. We start with a thin slab that extends from proper distance $r_p$ to $r_p+dr_p$.  The density contrast within this slab is $\drho_p = \rho_p - \bar\rho_p$, where $\rho_p = \rho_0 (1+z)^3$ is the proper density.  We can associate this slab with a plane of convergence $d\kappa$ as follows.  Consider a volume element that corresponds to solid angle $d\Omega$ and thickness $dr_p$.  The proper volume is
