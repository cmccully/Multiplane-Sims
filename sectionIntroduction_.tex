\section{Introduction}
Strong gravitational lensing is an important probe for many facets of cosmology. Analysis of strong lenses has led to constraints on the masses and properties of dark matter halos of galaxies \citep[e.g.,][]{Keeton98, Koopmans06, Barnabe09, Treu10}, substructure in galaxy halos \citep[e.g.,][]{Mao98, Metcalf01, Dalal02}, and the Hubble Constant, independent of the cosmic distance ladder \citep[e.g.][]{Refsdal64, Keeton97_PG1115, Kochanek03, Saha06, Oguri07}. Strong lensing may also be employed to constrain the properties of dark energy \citep[e.g.,][]{Turner90, Linder04, Linder11,Cao12, Treu13}.
