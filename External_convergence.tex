One of the key issues is that lens galaxies are not isolated systems. The ``external convergence'' produced by the environment of the lens galaxy and mass projected along the line of sight (hereafter environment/LOS) is one of the dominant components of the uncertainty budget on measurements of the Hubble Constant \citep{Suyu12}. So, our goal for this work is to explore the effects due mass outside the main lens galaxy on the measured Cosmology \footnote{Here we focus on the Hubble Constant, but similar arguments apply for time-delay cosmography measurements that have been proposed to be used to measure dark energy \citep{Treu13}.}. To quantify these effects, we employ two of the most common methodologies that treat the lensing LOS/environment.
