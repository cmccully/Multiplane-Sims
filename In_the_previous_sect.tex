In the previous section, we presented analytic arguments about how we expect the shear and flexion to behave. We now shift our focus to numerical simulations. These results are complementary to the analytic results above, as the numerical simulations can capture significantly more complicated behavior including all higher terms in the Taylor Series expansion. We use Lensmodel \citep{Keeton01} to simulate mock lenses and then fit them using a variety of models. The parameters in the simulations are allowed to vary to find a ``better fit'' even if the fit parameters are farther away from the truth.
