\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Bold}
  \B_j = \I - \sum_{i=1}^{j-1} \beta_{i\,j} \GammaMat_i \B_i
\end{equation}
where the sum runs over all shear and void planes, and the tidal matrix for a void plane is $\GammaMat_i = \kappa_i \I$.  First consider a case with the main plane in front ($i=1$) and void planes in the background.  Using three void planes, we can write
