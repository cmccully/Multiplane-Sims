Throughout this analysis, we compare three models that treat the environment/LOS in different ways. The first model ignores the environment/LOS contribution, which we term the ``Lens-Only'' model. The second model, the ``External Shear'' model, accounts for the environment/LOS by fitting an external shear in the main lens plane \citep[e.g.,][]{Suyu13}. The Shear model has two more free parameters than the None model. The last model we test uses our full LOS framework and is denoted as the ``LOS/ENV'' model. The LOS/ENV model has the same number of free parameters as the Lens-Only model, two less than the Shear model.
