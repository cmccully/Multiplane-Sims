Throughout this analysis, we compare three models that treat the environment/LOS in different ways. The first model ignores the environment/LOS contribution, which we term the ``Lens-Only'' model. The second model, the ``Lens+Shear'' model, accounts for the environment/LOS by fitting an external shear in the main lens plane \citep[e.g.,][]{Suyu13}. The Shear model has two more free parameters than the Lens-Only model. The last model is the full ``3-D Lens'' modles which uses our full LOS framework. The 3-D Lens model has the same number of free parameters as the Lens-Only model, two less than the Lens+Shear model.
