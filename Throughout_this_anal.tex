Throughout this analysis, we compare three models that treat the environment/LOS in different ways. The first model ignores the environment/LOS contribution, which we term the ``Lens-Only'' model. The second model, the ``External Shear'' model, accounts for the environment/LOS by fitting an external shear in the main lens plane \citep[e.g.,][]{Suyu13}. The Shear model has two more free parameters than the None model. The last model we test uses our full LOS framework and is denoted as the ``LOS/ENV'' model. The LOS/ENV model has the same number of free parameters as the Lens-Only model, two less than the Shear model. Note that for most of this work we assume that our model of the environment is known perfectly, but relax this assumption in Section \ref{sec:observations}.
