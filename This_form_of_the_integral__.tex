This form of the integral is recursive and is therefore unwieldy to use in practice, but is also suggestive that $\betahat$ can be described by a differential equation. First, we take a derivative of equation \ref{eqn:betahatint} with respect to the comoving diameter distance to plane $j$, $D_{C,j}$, which yields
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\betahat_{i j}}{d D_j} = \frac{d\beta_{i j}}{d D_j} - \int_{D_i}^{D_j} \betahat(z_i, z) \frac{d \beta(z, z_j)}{d D_j} \frac{d \kappa}{d D} d D.
\end{equation}
Note the second term from differentiating the integral term disappears because $\beta(z_j, z_j) = 0$.
