One of the simplest tests is to compare the results between two different fields. Using the same fiducial main lens galaxy ($R_E = 1.5"$ and $e=0.3$), we compare simulations for the B0712+472 field (hereafter B0712; \citealt{Jackson98}) shown in Figure \ref{fig:B0712} to RXJ1131 shown in Figure \ref{fig:RXJ1131}. One of the key differences between these fields is that the main lens galaxy of B0712 is not a member of a group. However, the results from B0712 and RXJ1131 are qualitatively similar. The deviations from the input parameters are similar for B0712 and RXJ1131, but RXJ1131 has a slightly larger contribution from LOS effects. While RXJ1131 is in a group, there is a group along the LOS to B0712 which may explain why the LOS/environment contributions are comparable, but the environment/LOS is more important for RXJ1131.
