One of the simplest tests is to compare the results between two different fields. Using the same fiducial main lens galaxy ($R_E = 1.5"$ and $e=0.3$), we compare simulations for the B0712+472 field (hereafter B0712; \citealt{Jackson98}) shown in Fig. \ref{fig:B0712} to B0712 shown in Fig. \ref{fig:RXJ1131}. One of the key differences between these fields is that the main lens galaxy is not a member of a group. The results from B0712 and RXJ1131 are qualitatively similar. The deviations from the input parameters are comparable for B0712 and RXJ1131. This suggests that the environment/LOS for RXJ1131 and B0712 are equally important. This may be the case because, while RXJ1131 is in a group, there is a group along the LOS to B0712. A detailed comparison across many different fields is beyond the scope of this paper, but we will briefly address this issue below and will revisit it in an upcoming work (Wong et al.,~in prep.).
