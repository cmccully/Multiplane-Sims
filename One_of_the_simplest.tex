One of the simplest tests is to compare the results between two different fields. Using the same fiducial main lens galaxy ($R_E = 1"$ and $e=0.3$), we compare simulations for the B1422+231 field (hereafter B1422; \citealt{Kundic97_b1422,Tonry98}) shown in Figure \ref{B1422} to B0712 shown in Figure \ref{B0712}. One of the key differences between these fields is that the main lens galaxy in B1422 is a a member of a group. We model the group halo as an NFW profile \citep[][note that the group halo is also subject to our cuts on $\Delta_3 x$]{Navarro97}. The results from B0712 and B1422 are qualitatively similar. Quantitatively the deviations from the input parameters are worse for B1422 than B0712, confirming that the environment is more important for B1422. A detailed comparison across many different fields is beyond the scope of this paper, but we will briefly address this issue below and will revisit it later (Wong et al.,~in prep.).
