If there is only mean density between redshifts $z_i$ and $z_j$, then there are no planes in the sum and hence $\C_{i j} = \beta_{i j } \I$: the connection between the planes is an isotropic tensor that depends on distance ratios. Now suppose that there are only void planes between $z_i$ and $z_j$, with $\GammaMat_k \rightarrow \Delta \kappa_k \I$. Since void planes are isotropic, $\C_{i j}$ will still be isotropic. Therefore, let us define $\betahat_{i j}$ where $\C_{i j} = \betahat_{i j} \I$. We point out that $\C_{i k } = \betahat_{i k} \I$ for all $i < k < j$. Using this definition along with the definition of $\C$ in equation \ref{eqn:cmatdef}, we see that $\betahat_{i j}$ must follow the recursion relation
\begin{equation}
\betahat_{i j}  = \beta_{i j} - \sum \limits_{k = i +1}^{j -1} \betahat_{i k} \beta_{k j} \Delta \kappa_k.
\label{eqn:betahatdef}{
\end{equation}
