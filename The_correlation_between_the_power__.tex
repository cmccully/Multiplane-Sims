The correlation between the power law index and the Hubble constant is due to the ``lens profile degeneracy'' \citep{Kochanek02}. In these simulations, we have placed no external constraints on the lens profile, so this drives the scatter in the recovered Hubble constant. \citet{Kochanek02} shows that the first order contribution to the lens profile degeneracy is $ 1 - \langle \kappa \rangle$ where $\langle \kappa \rangle$ is the average convergence from the main lens in the annulus between the image positions. If we take the image positions to be approximately at the Einstein radius, we can evaluate $k$ and average over angle,
\begin{equation}
\langle \kappa \rangle = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{0}^{2 \pi} \kappa(R_E, \theta) d \theta.
\end{equation}
