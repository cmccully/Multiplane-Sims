In M14 we presented a hybrid framework for multi-plane gravitational lensing that fills the gap between using the full multi-plane lens equation (which can be computationally expensive) and treating everything as a simple external shear (which omits higher-order effects that can be significant for objects projected near the lens). The framework can handle any mixture of ``main'' planes (strong lenses) that are given full treatment and ``tidal'' planes (weak lenses) that are treated using the tidal approximation. Our framework can be used to calculate all of the standard lensing observables including the effects from environment/LOS galaxies. The general expressions for the lens equation, magnification tensor, and time delay are as follows:
