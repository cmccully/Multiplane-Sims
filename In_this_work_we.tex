In this work we quantify when galaxies need to be included in our mass models and when they can be safely ignored. If we do decide to include include the galaxy in our models, we explore when we should treat it exactly as a main (strong) lens plane, or when the tidal (weak lensing) approximation is enough (i.e. higher order terms are non-negligible). We compare the results using our 3-D framework to the results from fitting an external shear.
