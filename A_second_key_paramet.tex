A second key parameter of the main lens galaxy is the Einstein radius, $R_E$ (the mass of the lens galaxy). Figure \ref{fig:recompare} shows $\eta$, $h$, and the scatter in $e$ for different values of $R_E$. As $R_E$ increases, the constraints on the Hubble constant get stronger. Lenses with large Einstein radii produce stronger constraints on the ellipticity limiting the lens profile degeneracy, yielding a tighter distribution on the Hubble constant.
