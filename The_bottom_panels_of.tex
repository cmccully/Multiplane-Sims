The bottom panels of Figure \ref{mockshear} show the scatter in the ellipticity, $e$, for the fits excluding higher order terms. The scatter from the Shear model peaks at $\sim 50\%$ and shows similar front to back difference as describe above. The None model has larger up to $\sim 100\%$ of the input $e$. Our interpretation of this scatter is that the model fit is trying to use the ellipticity to account for non-linear effects, but as the ellipticity is only a quadrapole, it cannot mimic these effects in general.
