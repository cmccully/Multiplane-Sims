\begin{equation}
\phi_p = R_p^2 \ln \left| \vx - \br \right| 
\end{equation}
where $R_p$ is the Einstein radius of the perturber, $\vx$ is the image position \textit{in the redshift plane of the perturber}, and $\br$ is the position of the perturber. If we let $|\x| = x$, $|\br| = r$, and $\theta$ is the angle between the perturber and the image position as measured from the origin, then we can rewrite the potential using the law of cosines as
