\begin{equation}
\phi_p = R_p^2 \ln \left| \x - \vec{r} \right| 
\end{equation}
where $R_p$ is the Einstein radius of the perturber, $\x$ is the image position \textit{in the redshift plane of the perturber}, and $\vec{r}$ is the position of the perturber. If we let $|\x| = x$, $|\vec{r}| = r$, and $\theta$ is the angle between the perturber and the image position as measured from the origin, then we can rewrite the potential using the law of cosines as
