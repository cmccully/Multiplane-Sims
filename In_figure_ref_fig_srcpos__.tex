In figure \ref{fig:srcpos}, we show the median and scatter in the best fit Hubble constant for each source position. Again, the models that ignore the environment do poorly for all source positions. The shear models and the LOS models do well when the source is near a caustic. However, near the center of the caustic, both sets of models have larger scatter in the recovered values for the Hubble constant. These source positions correspond to more symmetric image configurations, with the exact center producing an Einstein ring. These image configurations constrain the ellipticity less than asymmetric image configurations and are therefore more susceptible to lens profile degeneracy as discussed above.
