For either methodology of fitting an external shear or using our LOS framework, we still must choose which galaxies are treated exactly and which are treated in the tidal approximation. We find that we can reproduce the true lens parameters with no bias with scatter less than the observational uncertainties if we use a cutoff in $\Delta_3x$ of $3\times 10^{-5}$ arcseconds, a factor of 100 smaller than the assumed uncertainties on the observed positions.
