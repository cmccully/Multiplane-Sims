In Figure \ref{fig:srcpos}, we show the median and scatter in the best fit Hubble constant for each source position. Again, the Lens-Only models do poorly for all source positions. The Lens+Shear models and the 3-D Lens models do well when the source is near a caustic. However, near the center of the caustic, both sets of models have larger scatter in the recovered values for the Hubble constant. These source positions correspond to more symmetric image configurations, with the exact center producing an Einstein ring. Symmetric image configurations produce weaker constraints on the ellipticity than asymmetric image configurations and are therefore more susceptible to lens profile degeneracy as discussed above.
