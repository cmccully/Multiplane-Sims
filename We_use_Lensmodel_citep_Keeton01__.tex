We use Lensmodel \citep{Keeton01} to simulate mock lenses and then fit them using a variety of models. The parameters in the simulations are allowed to vary to find a ``better fit'' even if the fit parameters are farther away from the truth. In our Monte Carlo simulations, we use the full recursive lens equation given by equation \ref{eqn:mp_full}, making no approximations to generate the mock data. We define our fiducial measurement uncertainties as 3 milliarcseconds in the positions of the main galaxy and each of the images, $5\%$ in the flux, and 1 day in the time delay. These values are chosen to represent lenses targeted with some of the best current instruments like \textit{HST} and monitoring campaigns like COSMOGRAIL \citep{Eigenbrod05}. We use these uncertainties to define a $\chi^2$ of the fit. We do not explicitly add scatter to the mock observed quantities here, although preliminary tests that include such scatter has a ``floor'' in the $\chi^2$ and in the scatter in the recovered lens parameters. Otherwise these results are qualitatively similar, so we do not present them here.
