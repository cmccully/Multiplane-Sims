$\Delta_3 x$ has the units of arcseconds. Physically this quantity corresponds to the perturbation of the image positions at the Einstein radius of the main lens due to third order (flexion) terms. We will use the strength of the flexion terms to rank order the contributions from LOS galaxies in our simulations described below.
