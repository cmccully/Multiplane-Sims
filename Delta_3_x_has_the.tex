$\Delta_3 x$ has the units of arcseconds. Physically this quantity corresponds to the perturbation of the image positions at the Einstein radius of the main lens. $\Delta_3 x \propto R_p^2\propto M$, implying that more massive perturbers have a larger effect as expected. The $r^{-3}$ dependence shows that close perturbers are more important that distant perturbers, and the dependence on projected offset is much stronger than the dependence on the mass of the perturber.
