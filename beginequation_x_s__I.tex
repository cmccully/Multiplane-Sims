\begin{equation}
\x_s = (\I - \G) \x_1  - (\I - \beta \G)\al_g(\x_1) + \mathcal{O}(\x_1^3).

\end{equation}
This equation looks very similar to the single plane lens equation, but with some multiplicative factors. In fact, if we multiply both sides by $(\I - \beta \G)^{-1}$ from the left and define a scaled source coordinate $\bu_{\rm eff} \equiv (\I - \beta \G)^{-1} \x_s$, and define an effective shear as $(\I -\G_{\rm eff}) \equiv (\I - \beta\G)^{-1} (\I - \G)$, we get
