\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:background}
\x_s = (\I - \GammaMat) \x_1  - (\I - \beta \GammaMat)\al_g(\x_1) + \mathcal{O}(\x_1^3).
\end{equation}
This equation looks very similar to the single plane lens equation, but with some multiplicative factors. In fact, if we multiply both sides by $(\I - \beta \GammaMat)^{-1}$ from the left and define a scaled source coordinate $\vec{u}_{\rm eff} \equiv (\I - \beta \GammaMat)^{-1} \x_s$, and define an effective shear as $(\I -\GammaMat_{\rm eff}) \equiv (\I - \beta\GammaMat)^{-1} (\I - \GammaMat)$, we get
