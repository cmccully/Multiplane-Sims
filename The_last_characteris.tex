To test the prediction that galaxies in the background are down-weighted compared to those in the foreground, we ran a set of simulations griding over projected offset and redshift. For these simulations we fixed the mass of the perturber to be $10^{12} M_\odot$. We show the scatter in the Hubble Constant from the fits for the LOS/ENV models in Figure \ref{toyhd3x}. \footnote{When plotting the results, we use an $\asinh$ color scaling to illustrate the dynamic range of the variation. At large values, $\asinh$ acts like a logarithm, but at small values, it becomes linear. The $\asinh$ is well defined for both positive and negative numbers and is conveniently antisymmetric.} We find that perturbers behind the lens must be closer in projection than perturbers in the lens plane to have the same effect on the scatter in $h$. We have plotted a contour of constant $\Delta_3 x$, which nicely traces contours of constant scatter in the Hubble Constant, $h$. In the background, the effects of the point mass perturber are weaker because of the $\beta$ factors in $\Delta_3 x$. In the foreground, the strength of the perturber increases as $z \rightarrow 0$ due to its increasing Einstein radius as $z \rightarrow 0$. The shape of this curve is similar to the ``suspension bridge'' shape found by \citet{Momcheva06}.
