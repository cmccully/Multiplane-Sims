The last characteristic of interest of the perturbing galaxy is its redshift. As for the analytic expectation, the redshift dependency is the most complicated of three. Fixing the mass of the perturber at $10^{12} M_\odot$, we grid over projected offset from the main lens galaxy to the perturbing galaxy and the redshift of the perturbing galaxy. We show the scatter in the Hubble Constant from the fits for the LOS models in Figure \ref{toyh}. \footnote{When plotting the results, we use an $\asinh$ color scaling to illustrate the dynamic range of the variation. At large values, $\asinh$ acts like a logarithm, but at small values, it becomes linear. The $\asinh$ is well defined for both positive and negative numbers and is conveniently antisymmetric.} We find that perturbers behind the lens must be closer in projection than perturbers in the lens plane to have the same effect on the scatter in $h$. We have plotted a contour of constant $\Delta_3 x$, which nicely traces contours of constant scatter in the Hubble Constant, $h$. In the background, the effects of the point mass perturber are weaker because of the $\beta$ factors in $\Delta_3 x$. In the foreground, the strength of the perturber increases as $z \rightarrow 0$ due to its increasing Einstein radius as $z \rightarrow 0$.
