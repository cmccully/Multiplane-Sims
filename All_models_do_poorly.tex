All models do poorly when none of the LOS galaxies are treated exactly. However, if we treat the closest few perturbers exactly (the galaxy distribution is shown the histogram in the bottom of the panels), the bias and scatter become negligible in our LOS models. A cutoff of $10^{-4}$ arcseconds has negligible scatter in all of the recovered parameters. This cut leaves $\sim 8$ perturbers that need to be treated exactly out of the $\sim 300$ total, a factor of more than $10^3$ increase in efficiency.
