All models do the worst when none of the LOS galaxies are treated exactly. However, if we treat the closest few perturbers exactly (the galaxy distribution is shown the histogram in the bottom of the panels), the bias and scatter become dominated by the observational uncertainties for our LOS models. A cutoff of $10^{-4}$ arcseconds has no bias in any of the recovered parameters and the reduced $\chi^2$ of the LOS models are $\sim 1$. This cut leaves $\sim 15$ perturbers that need to be treated exactly out of the $\sim 300$ total, a factor of more than $400$ increase in efficiency.
