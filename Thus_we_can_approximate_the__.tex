Thus we can approximate the average convergence at the Einstein radius as 
\begin{equation}
\langle \kappa \rangle \approx \frac{1}{2} \eta  (1 - e)^{2 - \eta} \left(1 +  e - \frac{e \eta }{2}\right).
\end{equation}
In figure \ref{fig:scaled_triangle} we show the recovered distributions for the Hubble constant, scaled by the lens profile degeneracy factor $1 - \langle \kappa \rangle$. Most of the correlation with power law index and ellipticity is removed. The remaining is likely due to higher multipole moments of both the average convergence and the lens profile degeneracy \citep{Kochanek02}.
