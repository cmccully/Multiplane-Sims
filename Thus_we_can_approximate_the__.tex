Thus we can approximate the average convergence at the Einstein radius as 
\begin{equation}
\langle \kappa \rangle \approx \frac{1}{2} \eta  (1 - e)^{2 - \eta} \left(1 +  e - \frac{e \eta }{2}\right).
\end{equation}
In Figure \ref{fig:scaled_triangle} we show the recovered distributions for the Hubble constant, scaled by the lens profile degeneracy factor $1 - \langle \kappa \rangle$. Most of the correlation with power law index and ellipticity is removed. The remaining is likely due to higher multi-pole moments of both the average convergence and the lens profile degeneracy \citep{Kochanek02}.
