If we now remove the higher order terms in $\al_p$ by truncating the Taylor series in $\al_p$ at the first order in $\al_p$ (second order in $\phi_p$), which defines the ``tidal approximation'', and note that $\al_p(0)$ corresponds to a constant deflection, which is unobservable, and write $\Gamma^{ij}$ as a matrix $\G$, we get
