Figure \ref{mockshear} shows the $\chi^2$ values when the higher order terms are removed and only the non-linearity of the multi-plane lens equation is taken into account. The models that include an external shear show a striking difference between the foreground and background perturbers. As argued in Section \ref{sec:background}, the shear matrix of a foreground perturbing galaxy goes into the argument of the deflection angle making it impossible for the Shear model to mimic this effect. Figure \ref{mockshear} confirms that all of the non-linearity in the shear terms is from foreground perturbers. However, the fitted shear, even in the case of the background perturber, is fit in the lens plane, and is thus not the true shear in the redshift plane of the perturbing galaxy. The $\chi^2$ of the None models, on the hand, follows a combination of the strength of the shear which gives a ``suspension bridge'' shape \citep{Momcheva06} and the foreground contributions seen in the Shear models.
