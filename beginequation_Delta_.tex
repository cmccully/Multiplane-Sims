\begin{equation}
\Delta_3 \vx = \frac{1}{2} (\vx'_1 - \beta R_E \rhat) \sF (\vx'_1 - \beta R_E \rhat).
\end{equation}
Now, if we define the perturber to be colinear with the image position ($\theta  = 0$, if we take the full root mean square yields an extra factor of $\sqrt{2}$ that we omit for simplicity) and that the positions of the multiple images are $\vx'_1 \approx \vx_1 \approx R_E$, and take the magnitude of $\Delta_3 \vx$, we can substitute in
