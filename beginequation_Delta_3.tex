\begin{equation}
\Delta_3 x = \frac{R_E^2 R_p^2}{r^3}.
\end{equation}
Note that in this case, $r$ is the offset of the perturber as measured on the sky. This is the quantity we will use for calculating the contributions of higher order terms for perturbers in the foreground of the main lens. In the main lens plane, $\beta = 0$ and $\Delta_3 x$ is equal to the background case.
