\begin{equation}
\Delta_3 x = \frac{R_E^2 R_p^2}{r^3}.
\end{equation}
This equation is similar to equation \ref{eq:backgroundd3x}, but without any redshift factors. Therefore, not only can foreground perturbers not be mimicked by an external shear because of non-linear effects, but background perturbers are also down-weighted compared to foreground galaxies.
