\begin{equation}
\Bmat_\ell = \Imat - \beta_{1\ell}\Gammamat_1  - \beta_{2\ell} \Gammamat_2 \Bmat_2  - \beta_{3\ell}\kappa_3 \Bmat_{3} - \beta_{4\ell} \kappa_{4} \Bmat_{4}.
\end{equation}
Our goal is to write these expressions such that we can let $\kappa_i$ become infinitesimal and evaluate this for an infinite number of ``void planes''. To do this, we must explicitly separate the ``void planes'' and the ``tidal planes'' (that can include a shear).
