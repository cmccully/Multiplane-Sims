The angular part of equation \ref{eqn:powerlaw} cannot be integrated analytically. However, by doing a Taylor series expansion of powers of the ellipticity, $e$, the integral can be solved. Using Mathematica, we find that 
\begin{equation}
\int_0^{2 \pi} \frac{d \theta}{ (1 - 2 e \cos^2(\theta) + e^2\cos^2(\theta))^{1 - \eta / 2}} \approx 1 + e  - \frac{ e \eta}{2}.
\end{equation}
For our parameter values of interest, we find, numerically, that this approximation is good to $\sim1\%$.
