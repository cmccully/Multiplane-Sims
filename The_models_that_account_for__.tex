The models that account for the LOS/environment using an external shear are shown in figure \ref{fig:shear_triangle}. The shear models show more scatter than the LOS models and have a bias in some of the recovered parameters, most dramatically, the Einstein radius parameter, $b$, and the Hubble constant. This will be discussed in more detail below. The distributions of the recovered parameters for the shear models are more complex than the LOS models, with some evidence of multiple families of best fit solutions. The same strong correlations between the ellipticity, power law index, and the Hubble constant are also present in the shear models.
