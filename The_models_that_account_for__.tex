The models that account for the LOS/environment using an external shear are shown in figure \ref{fig:shear_triangle}. The shear models show more scatter than the LOS models and have a bias in some of the recovered parameters, most dramatically, the Einstein radius parameter, $b$, and the Hubble constant. This will be discussed in more detail below.
