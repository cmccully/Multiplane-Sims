While the external convergence does not capture all LOS effects, as described above, it is a useful quantity to compare to previous works. \citet{Suyu13} use the Millenium simulation along with galaxy number counts around RXJ1131 to estimate their prior probability distribution for the external convergence used to measure the Hubble constant, shown in red in Figure \ref{fig:suyu}. We calculate the effective convergence (as defined in M14 and references therein), marginalizing over the environment models for RXJ1131. The histogram of effective convergence for 1000 environment trials is shown in blue in Figure \ref{fig:suyu}. We find that the peaks of the distributions match very closely. However, our 3-D Lens models produce a tighter distribution on the convergence. This is likely because we build mass models based on the observed beam for each individual lens rather than using statistical results from N-body simulations. The narrower distribution of external convergences translates into a stronger prior on measuring the Hubble constant.
