\begin{equation}
\x_s = \B_s \x_1 - \Cmat_{\ell s} \al(\B_\ell \x_1).
\end{equation}
Similar to the case of the foreground perturber, $\B_\ell$ is in the argument of the deflection of the main lens galaxy, leading to non-linear effects that we quantify and explore using our numerical results in the following sections.
