\begin{equation}

which is equivalent to the single plane lens equation with an external shear in the lens plane \citep[see also ][]{Schneider97}. We are allowed to rescale the source plane because the position of the source is unobservable and we typically only measure the ratio of the fluxes of different images, which is insensitive to the absolute intrinsic luminosity of the source\footnote{The absolute luminosity of lensed standard candles, like lensed type Ia supernovae \citep{Patel14, Kolatt98}, can be used as an extra constraint removing the ability to rescale the source plane and is therefore a novel way to break the mass sheet degeneracy.}.
