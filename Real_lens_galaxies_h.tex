Real lens galaxies have many perturbers, typically $\sim 300$ out to $5'$ from the lens, but deciding which are important is not a simple problem. One concern is whether to treat each LOS galaxy exactly or using the shear approximation. We examine the field RXJ1131-1231 (hereafter RXJ1131, e.g. \citealt{Suyu13}) as a fiducial mass model to draw general conclusions about LOS effects for realistic beams. We use the measured redshifts of RXJ1131, $z_{\rm{lens}} = 0.2936$ and $z_{\rm{source}} = 0.658$.  The main lens galaxy of RXJ1131 is a member of a group. Note that the group halo is also subject to our cuts on $\Delta_3 x$. We adopt an Einstein radius of $R_E = 1.5''$, close to the true value \citep{Suyu13} and the peak of the observed distribution \citep{Sonnenfeld13}, and an ellipticity of $e=0.3$.
