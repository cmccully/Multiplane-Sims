Real lens galaxies have many perturbers, typically $\sim 300$ out to $5'$ from the lens, but deciding which are important is not a simple problem. Again, our key concern here is whether to treat each LOS galaxy exactly or using the shear approximation. We begin by using the field RXJ1131-1231 (hereafter RXJ1131, e.g. \citealt{Suyu13}) as a fiducial mass model to draw general conclusions about LOS effects for realistic beams. We use the measured redshifts of RXJ1131, $z_{\rm{lens}} = 0.2936$ and $z_{\rm{source}} = 0.658$.  The main lens galaxy of RXJ1131 is a member of a group. We model the group halo as an NFW profile \citep[][note that the group halo is also subject to our cuts on $\Delta_3 x$]{Navarro97}.
