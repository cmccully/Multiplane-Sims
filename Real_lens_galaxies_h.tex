Real lens galaxies have many perturbers, typically $\sim 300$ out to $5\arcmin$ from the lens, but deciding which are important is not a simple problem. Again, our key concern here is whether to treat each LOS galaxy exactly or using the shear approximation. We begin by using the field B0712+472 (hereafter B0712; \citealt{Jackson98}) as a fiducial mass model to draw general conclusions about LOS effects for realistic beams. Note that B0712 does not have a group at the main lens redshift, although it does have one in the foreground of the lens. We then test the robustness of our results by considering a field for which the main lens galaxy lies in a group (Section \ref{sec:B1422}) and varying the properties of the main lens galaxy (Section \ref{sec:mainlens_vary}).
