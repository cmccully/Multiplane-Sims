\label{fig:ecompare} Recovered lens parameters for main lens galaxies with different ellipticities for the RXJ1131 field. The LOS models are shown in blue, the Shear models in red, and the None models in green. Each column corresponds to $e = 0.1,0.3,0.5$, respectively. We now test how our results change based on our assumptions about the ellipticity of the main galaxy. Systems with larger $e$ have better $\chi^2$ and less scatter in the Hubble Constant. The scatter in the Hubble Constant is mostly driven by the relative precision of the time delay. Because we assume an absolute uncertainty of 1 day on the time delays, longer time delays have smaller fractional uncertainties leading to a stronger constraint on Hubble constant.
