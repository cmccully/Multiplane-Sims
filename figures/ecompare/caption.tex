\label{fig:ecompare} Recovered lens parameters for main lens galaxies with different ellipticities for the RXJ1131 field. The LOS models are shown in blue, the Shear models in red, and the None models in green. Each column corresponds to $e = 0.1,0.3,0.5$, respectively. Systems with larger $e$ less scatter in the power law index $\eta$ and the Hubble Constant. The stronger constraints on the ellipticity cause the models to be less sensitive to the lens profile degeneracy and therefore produce tighter constraints on the Hubble constant.
