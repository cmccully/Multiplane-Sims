\label{fig:ecompare} Recovered lens parameters for main lens galaxies with different ellipticities for the RXJ1131 field. The 3-D models are shown in blue, the Lens+Shear models in red, and the Lens-Only models in green. The columns correspond to $e = 0.1,0.3,0.5$, respectively. Systems with larger $e$ have less scatter in the power law index, $\eta$, and the Hubble Constant. More asymmetric lenses produce stronger constraints on the ellipticity which in turn breaks the lens profile degeneracy and produces tighter constraints on the Hubble constant.
