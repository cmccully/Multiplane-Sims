\label{fig:RXJ1131} Recovered lens model parameters for the RXJ1131 field as a function of which galaxies are modeled as strong lenses. LOS/ENV galaxies with a $\Delta_3 x$ greater than a given point are treated as strong lenses. The 3-D Lens models are shown in blue, the Lens+Shear models in red, and the Lens-Only models in green. We used MCMC to calculate the marginalized 1-D posterior probability distribution. The error bars have contributions from measurement uncertainties, scatter from varying source positions and orientation of the main lens, and the lens profile degeneracy. A histogram of $\Delta_3 x$ for the LOS/environment galaxies is shown in the bottom panel (see Figure \ref{fig:d3xhist}) to show which galaxies are being treated as strong lenses. The leftmost point corresponds to treating all galaxies as part of the LOS/ENV, while models all the way to the right take into account all perturbing galaxies as strong lens. For $\Delta_3 x < 1e-4$, the scatter in all of the lens parameters is dominated by the lens profile degeneracy for the 3-D Lens models. The Lens-Only and Lens+Shear models over predict the Einstein radius (top panel) when most of the galaxies are not treated as strong lenses due to the external convergence. At small values of $\Delta_3 x$, shown on the right of the plots, the fitted Einstein radius drops below the truth because we have not included a void correction in the Lens-Only and Lens+Shear. This implies that for this lens, the correction due to voids is a few percent.
