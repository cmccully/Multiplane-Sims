\label{B0712} Recovered lens model parameters for the B0712 field. The LOS models are shown in blue, the Shear models in red, and the None models in green. We used MCMC to calculate the full posterior probability distribution. The error bars have contributions from both measurement uncertainties and scatter from varying source positions and orientations of the main lens. A histogram of LOS/environment galaxies is shown along the bottom with the axis labels on the far right. Dark grey bins correspond to perturbers in the foreground of the main lens, and the light grey bins correspond to background perturbers. The x-axis shows the cutoff in $\Delta_3 x$. Any galaxy to the left of a point is treated exactly as a main plane (strong lens), while everything to the right is treated according to the model: the None models ignore the environment, the Shear models fit only a simple shear, and the LOS models use our framework using the tidal approximation. The leftmost point corresponds to using the shear approximation for all galaxies. If we went all the way to the right (there are many galaxies beyond the edge of what is shown) all of the galaxies would be taken into account exactly. Note that moving to the right corresponds to taking galaxies into account exactly that are farther away from the main lens.
