\label{fig:frontback} Recovered lens model parameters for simulations that do not include higher order terms. The main lens has a redshift of $z_\ell = 0.3$ and the perturber has mass of $10^{12}~ M_\odot$. For these models, we have taken out the higher order terms in the lensing potential when generating mock data to emphasize the differences between our environment/LOS framework and the traditional ways of accounting for the LOS. The Lens-Only model are affected by LOS galaxies at all redshifts. In the background, the Shear models can effectively capture all of the LOS effects from a single perturber, whereas, in the foreground, the Shear model cannot mimic a LOS galaxy due to non-linear effects.
