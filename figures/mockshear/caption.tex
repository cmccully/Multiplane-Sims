\label{fig:frontback} Recovered lens model parameters for simulations that do not include higher order terms. The main lens has a redshift of $z_\ell = 0.3$ and the perturber has mass of $10^{12}~ M_\odot$. We have now shifted our attention from the contribution of higher order terms to non-linear effects in the multi-plane lens equation. For these models, we have taken out the higher order terms in the lensing potential by generating mock data to emphasize the differences between our environment/LOS framework and the traditional ways of accounting for the LOS. The None model contours look very similar to the previous simulations that included higher order terms. The Shear model results are strikingly different than in previous simulations: in the background, the Shear models have a $\chi^2$ of effectively 0, whereas, in the foreground, the fits are much worse due to non-linear effects.
