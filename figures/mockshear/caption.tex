\label{fig:frontback} Recovered lens model parameters for simulations that do not include higher order terms. The main lens has a redshift of $z_\ell = 0.3$ (marked by the white dashed line) and the perturber has mass of $10^{12}~ M_\odot$. For these models, we have taken out the higher order terms in the lensing potential when generating mock data to emphasize the differences between our 3-D Lens framework and the traditional method of using Lens+Shear. In the background, the Lens+Shear models can effectively capture all of the LOS effects from a single perturber, whereas, in the foreground, the Lens+Shear model cannot mimic a LOS galaxy due to non-linear effects.
