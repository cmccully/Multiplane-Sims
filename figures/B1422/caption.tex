\label{fig:B0712} Recovered lens model parameters for the B0712 field, similar to Fig. \ref{fig:RXJ1131}. Note that B0712 also includes a group of galaxies along the LOS. The environment/LOS effects are comparable and the qualitative trends of the recovered parameters are the same between RXJ1131 and B0712. The difference in the recovered Einstein radius when neglecting external convergence is larger for RXJ1131, but the correction due to voids is larger for B0712, $\sim4\%$.
