\label{B1422} Recovered lens model parameters for the B1422 field, which includes a group of galaxies at the main lens redshift. Similar to Figure \ref{B0712}. By comparing this field to B0712, we can test how robust our conclusions about LOS cuts are. The environment/LOS effects are stronger here than for B0712. Otherwise, the qualitative trends of the recovered parameters are the same between the two fields.
