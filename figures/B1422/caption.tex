\label{fig:B0712} Recovered lens model parameters for the B0712 field, which includes a group of galaxies along the LOS. Similar to Fig. \ref{fig:RXJ1131}. By comparing this field to RXJ1131, we can test how robust our conclusions about LOS cuts are. The environment/LOS effects are comparable and the qualitative trends of the recovered parameters are the same between the two fields.
