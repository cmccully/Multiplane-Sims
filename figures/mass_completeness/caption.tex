\label{fig:mass_complete} Mass completeness as a function of redshift. The blue line shows the average mass per redshift bin across all of our mass models. The red line shows the best fit to the data using a functional form of $f(z) = e^{-z^a / b}$ with best fit parameters $a = 3.23$ and $b = 0.183$. Because this is a fit to the average across mass models, individual beams can be over dense or under dense compared to the mean density of the universe. The only assumption is that the average of our beams should be approximately the mean density of the universe.
