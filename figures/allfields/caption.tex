\label{fig:allfields} $\Delta_3x$ for nine lens fields, similar to the left panel in Figure \ref{fig:fieldrz}. Each galaxy in the mass model is shown in projection on the sky. The areas of the points are proportional to the mass of the galaxy. X's are behind the main lens galaxy, while O's are in the foreground, and the diamonds represent group members. The color of the points represents the strength of the higher order terms characterized by $\Delta_3 x$. There is dramatic variation in the LOS/environment strengths across the different fields implying that each field needs to be treated on an individual basis.
