\label{fig:srcpos} Median value (top) and scatter (bottom) of the recovered Hubble constant as a function of source position. The models that ignore the LOS/environment (left) have a large bias in the fitted Hubble constant for a variety of source positions. The external shear models (center) show less bias for most source positions, but some source positions still have significant bias. The models that include the LOS produce little bias and small scatter for all but the central source positions. These correspond to more symmetric image configurations which produce weaker constraints on the ellipticity and are therefore more susceptible to the lens profile degeneracy.
