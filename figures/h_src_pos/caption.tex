\label{fig:srcpos} Median value (top) and scatter (bottom) of the recovered Hubble constant as a function of source position. The Lens-Only models (left) have a large bias in the fitted Hubble constant for a variety of source positions. The Lens+Shear models (center) show less bias for most source positions, but some source positions still have significant bias. The 3-D Lens models produce little bias and small scatter for all but the central source positions. These source positions correspond to more symmetric image configurations which produce weaker constraints on the ellipticity and are therefore more susceptible to the lens profile degeneracy.
