\label{timedelays} Time delay distributions for lens galaxies with different ellipticities. The red histogram shows the time delays for $e =0.3$ while the blue shows the distribution for $e=0.5$. The models with a higher ellipticity have longer time delays. Assuming a constant absolute uncertainty on the time delay implies that more elliptical, asymmetric lenses will have a smaller fractional uncertainty on the time delay leading to stronger constraints on $h$.
