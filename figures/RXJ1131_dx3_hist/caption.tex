\label{fig:d3xhist} Distribution of $\Delta_3 x$ for RXJ1131. The dark gray bins represent foreground perturbing galaxies, while the light gray bins represent background perturbing galaxies. The silver bins between the dark and light bins correspond to group members in the local environment. As anticipated, foreground perturbers and group members tend to have larger $\Delta_3 x$ values than background perturbers.
