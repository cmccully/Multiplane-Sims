\label{fig:fieldrz} $\Delta_3x$ for each of the components of the lensing mass model for RXJ1131. On the left, each galaxy in the mass model is shown in projection on the sky. The areas of the points are proportional to the mass of the galaxy. The main lens redshift is indicated by the dotted line in the right panel. X's are behind the main lens galaxy, while the O's are in front of the main lens galaxy. The diamonds are group members in the environment of RXJ 1131. The group halo is marked with a star. The color of the points represents the strength of the higher order terms measured by $\Delta_3 x$. The right panel shows the same galaxies plotted in the $r$-$z$ projection. Two $\Delta_3 x$ contours have been shown to guide the eye. The red section of the contour shows how to translate the perturbing galaxy to its effective offset if it was in the lens plane.
