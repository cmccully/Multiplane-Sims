\label{fig:fieldrz} $\Delta_3x$ for each of the galaxies of the mass model for RXJ1131. On the left, each galaxy in the lens model is shown in projection on the sky. The areas of the points are proportional to the mass of the given galaxy. X's are behind the main lens galaxy, while the O's are in front of the main lens galaxy. The diamonds are group members in the environment of RXJ1131. The group halo is marked with a star. The color of the points represents the strength of the lensing effects measured by $\Delta_3 x$. The right panel shows the same galaxies plotted in the $r$-$z$ projection. The main lens redshift is indicated by the dotted line. Two $\Delta_3 x$ contours have been shown to guide the eye. The red section of the contour illustrates how to translate the perturbing galaxy to its effective offset as if it was in the main lens plane. Note, there is not a simple radial cut that will capture all the most important LOS galaxies.
