\label{fig:toyr3} Deviation in recovered parameter for single perturber simulations as a function of projected radial offset of the perturber. Each column represents a different model: Lens-Only, Lens+Shear, and 3-D Lens models respectively. Each row shows the results for a different parameter: $\chi^2$; scatter in the Hubble Constant ($h$) and scatter in ellipticity ($e$). Both the scatter and the $\chi^2$ follow power laws in projected offset, $r$. Our expectations for the power law indices are shown in black for each of the parameters. The Lens-Only models ignore even the second order terms so we expect the scatter to go as $r^{-2}$ and the $\chi^2$ to go as the square of the scatter, $r^{-4}$. The 3-D Lens and Lens+Shear models omit third order terms and higher, so we expect the scatter to follow $r^{-3}$ and the $\chi^2$ to follow $r^{-6}$, respectively. Three decades of mass are shown for each of the models. In every case, the scatter is proportional to the mass, which for a point mass is proportional to $R_p^2$, matching our expectations based on the a Taylor Series expansion of the potential.
