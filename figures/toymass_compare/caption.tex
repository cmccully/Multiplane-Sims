\label{masscompare} Lens model results for single perturber mock data as a function of projected radial offset of the perturber. Our goal is to isolate the three main perturber parameters mass $M$, radial offset $r$, and redshift $z$ to build up each component of $\Delta_3 x$. We start by removing the redshift dependence by placing the perturbing galaxy at the same redshift as the main lens galaxy ($z_{\rm{lens}} = 0.3$). Each column represents a different model: None, Shear, and LOS models, respectively. Each row shows the results for a different parameter: $\chi^2$, scatter in the Hubble Constant, $h$, and scatter in ellipticity, $e$, respectively. Both the scatter and the $\chi^2$ follow power laws in radial offset, $r$. Our expectations for the power law indices are shown in black for each of the parameters. The None models ignore even the second order terms so we expect the scatter to go as $r^{-2}$ and the $\chi^2$ as the square of the scatter $r^{-4}$. The LOS and Shear models omit third order terms and higher, so we expect the scatter to follow $r^{-3}$ and the $\chi^2$ to follow $r^{-6}$, respectively. This confirms our expectation that $\Delta_3 x \propto r^{-3}$. Three decades of mass are shown for each of the models. In every case, the contribution due to higher order terms scales linearly with the mass, showing that $\Delta_3 x \propto M$.
