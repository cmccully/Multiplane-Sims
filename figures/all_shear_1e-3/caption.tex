\label{fig:shear_triangle} Distribution of recovered model parameters from the Lens+Shear models; similar to Figure \ref{fig:los_triangle}. The corresponding parameter ranges are the same as Figures \ref{fig:los_triangle} and \ref{fig:scaled_triangle} to facilitate direct comparison. In many of the parameters, there is a significant bias in the recovered results (the true input parameters are marked with a cross). Most notably, there is a bias in the recovered Einstein radius ($b$) for the Lens+Shear models that is not present in the 3-D Lens models. While the 3-D Lens models include external convergence implicitly, the Lens+Shear models must add the external convergence in post-processing. The 3-D lens models also produce tighter constraints that the Lens+Shear models on all free parameters. The recovered distributions are more complex than the distributions from the 3-D Lens models as shown in figure \ref{fig:los_triangle}, possibly suggesting multiple families of best fit solutions. The strong correlations between power law index, ellipticity, and the Hubble constant are also present in the Lens+Shear models, as the Lens+Shear models are also sensitive to the lens profile degeneracy.
