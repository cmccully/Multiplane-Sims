\label{fig:shear_triangle} Distribution of recovered model parameters from the Shear models. The recovered distributions are more complex than the distributions from the LOS models as shown in figure \ref{fig:los_triangle}, possibly suggesting multiple families of best fit solutions. The strong correlations between power law index, ellipticity, and the Hubble constant are also present in the Shear models.
