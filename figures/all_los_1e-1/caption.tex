\label{fig:los_triangle} Recovered model parameters for the LOS fits of RXJ1131. For these results, all of the LOS/environment galaxies are treated in using the shear approximation. There is no bias in the recovered parameters, but there are strong correlations between ellipticity, the power law index, and the Hubble constant. This is a manifestation of the lens profile degeneracy \citep{Kochanek02}. The plotting ranges for these parameters are the same as Figures \ref{fig:shear_triangle} and \ref{fig:scaled_triangle} to facilitate direct comparison.
