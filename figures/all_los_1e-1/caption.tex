\label{fig:los_triangle} Recovered model parameters for the LOS fits of RXJ1131. For these results, all of the LOS/environment galaxies are treated in using the shear approximation. Contours containing $68\%$ and $95\%$ of the MCMC trials are shown in white. There is no bias in the recovered parameters (the true input value is marked with a cross). However, there are strong correlations between ellipticity, the power law index, and the Hubble constant. This is a manifestation of the lens profile degeneracy \citep{Kochanek02}. The plotting ranges for corresponding parameters are the same as Figures \ref{fig:shear_triangle} and \ref{fig:scaled_triangle} to facilitate direct comparison.
