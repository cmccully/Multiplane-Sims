\label{fig:recompare} Recovered lens parameters for main lens galaxies with different Einstein radii for the B0712 field. Similar to Figure \ref{fig:ecompare}. Each column corresponds to a different Einstein radius $R_E = 0.5,1.0,1.5$, respectively. The systems with a smaller $R_E$ have smaller $\chi^2$ but more scatter in the Hubble Constant. The larger scatter is due to the shorter time delays leading to a larger fractional uncertainty, which directly translates into a weaker constraint on the Hubble Constant. However, the LOS contributes to systems with a smaller $R_E$ less than for a large Einstein radius. This is because, for a fixed LOS model on the sky, perturbing galaxies are more Einstein radii away for a low mass main lens galaxy than for a high mass main lens galaxy.
