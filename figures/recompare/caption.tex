\label{fig:recompare} Recovered lens parameters for main lens galaxies with different Einstein radii for the RXJ1131 field. Similar to Figure \ref{fig:ecompare}. The columns correspond to Einstein radii of $b = 0.5,1.0,1.5$, respectively. The systems with a smaller $R_E$ have more scatter in the Hubble Constant. The constraints on the ellipticity is slightly stronger for lenses with larger Einstein radii, especially once the few strongest LOS/ENV galaxies are included in the models. This implies that lenses that have a large Einstein radius should produce the to strongest constraints on the Hubble constant.
