\label{fig:recompare} Recovered lens parameters for main lens galaxies with different Einstein radii for the RXJ1131 field. Similar to Figure \ref{fig:ecompare}. Each column corresponds to a different Einstein radius $b = 0.5,1.0,1.5$, respectively. The systems with a smaller $R_E$ have more scatter in the Hubble Constant. The shorter time delays lead to a larger fractional uncertainty, which directly translates into a weaker constraint on the Hubble Constant. The constraints on the ellipticity is also slightly stronger for lenses with larger Einstein radii which also leads to stronger constraints on the Hubble constant.
