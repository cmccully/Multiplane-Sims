\label{toyhd3x} Scatter in the recovered Hubble Constant, $h$, for the LOS models scaled to the input value of $h=0.71$ for quad images. The main lens has a redshift of $z_\ell = 0.3$ which is marked with a dotted line. We now remove the dependence of $\Delta_3 x$ on mass by fixing the perturber mass to $10^{12}~ M_\odot$ and varying its offset and redshift. We have overplotted a line with the $\beta$ factors derived in sections \ref{sec:background} and \ref{sec:foreground}. This line follows contours of constant scatter in $h$ well showing that our definition of $\Delta_3 x$ is a good characterization of the effects of higher order terms.
