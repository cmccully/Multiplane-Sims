\label{toyhd3x} Scatter in the recovered Hubble Constant, $h$, for the 3-D Lens models scaled to the input value of $h=0.71$. The main lens has a redshift of $z_\ell = 0.3$ which is marked with a dotted line, and the perturbing galaxy has a mass of $10^{12} M_\odot$. We have overplotted a line with the $\beta$ factors derived in sections \ref{sec:background} and \ref{sec:foreground}. This line follows nicely traces contours of constant scatter in $h$ showing that our definition of $\Delta_3 x$ is a good characterization of perturbations to the lens potential due to the LOS. This parameter allows to compare the effects of LOS galaxies even if they are at different redshifts.
