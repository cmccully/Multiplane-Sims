\label{fig:scaled_triangle} Recovered lens parameter for the 3-D Lens models, scaled to remove the lens profile degeneracy. We approximate the average convergence as $\langle \kappa \rangle \approx \frac{1}{2} \eta  (1 - e)^{2 - \eta} \left(1 +  e - \frac{e \eta }{2}\right).$ The correlations between the Hubble constant and the ellipticity and power law index are mostly removed. The residual correlations are likely due to higher multi-pole moments. The plotted parameter ranges are the same as Figures \ref{fig:los_triangle} and \ref{fig:shear_triangle} to facilitate direct comparison.
