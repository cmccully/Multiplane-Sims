\label{fig:suyu} Probability distribution of external convergence. The blue histogram shows the inferred effective convergence marginalizing over environment. The red line shows the external convergence distribution derived from the Millenium simulation in \citet{Suyu13}. The peak of distributions match well. Because we build mass models for each specific beam instead of using simple galaxy counts, the distribution from our LOS models is narrower.
