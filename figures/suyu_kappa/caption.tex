\label{fig:suyu} Probability distribution of external convergence. The blue histogram shows the inferred external convergence from the Shear models. The external convergence was calculated by measuring the offset in the best-fit Einstein radius of the shear models with $\kappa = 1 - R_{E, \rm{fit}} / R_{E,\rm{truth}}$. The red line shows the external convergence distribution derived from the Millenium simulation in \citet{Suyu13}. The gray line and green line are the effective and total convergence (as defined in M14) respectively. The peak of distribution from our models is well matched to the effective convergence, while the mean of the distribution from \citet{Suyu13} more closely matches the total convergence. We note that our current models do not include the uncertainty from generating the environment models so we expect the distribution from our models to broaden when taking the full set of uncertainties into account.
