\label{fig:suyu} Probability distribution of external convergence for RXJ1131. The blue histogram shows the inferred effective convergence marginalizing over the uncertainties in generating the 3-D Lens models. The red line shows the external convergence distribution derived from the Millenium simulation in \citet{Suyu13}. The peak of the distributions match well. Because we build mass models for each specific beam instead of using simple galaxy counts, the distribution from our LOS models is narrower, effectively producing a stronger prior on the Hubble constant.
