Now that we have justified each piece of $\Delta_3 x$ for a single perturber, we use $\Delta_3 x$ to characterize the environment/LOS contribution for each of the galaxies in our realistic and more complex mass models in Section \ref{sec:reallos}. However, it is first useful to use the single perturber simulations examine contributions from non-linear effects by removing the higher order terms.
