\begin{equation}
  dM = \pi\theta^2 D_\ell^2\ \drho_p\ dr_p
\end{equation}
where we switch notation from $r_a$ to $D_\ell$ because that is the relevant angular diameter distance, but we keep $dr_p$ to remind us that we are talking about the thickness in terms of proper distance.  The mass creates deflection
