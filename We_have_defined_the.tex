We find that perturbers in the foreground of the lens affect the lens potential more than those in the background for two different reasons. The first is that background perturbers are downweighted; a background perturber must be closer in projection to have the same effect as a foreground perturber. The second is that while background perturbers can be mimicked by a shear in the lens plane, foreground perturbers can not. Foreground perturbers create non-linear effects that cannot be fit with a simple external shear.
