Figure \ref{allfields} shows $\Delta_3 x$ for nine other actual multiply-imaged QSO fields from \citet{Wong11}. Not surprisingly, these fields are also very complex. There is not a simple radial cut that can characterize the contributions from higher order terms. There is striking diversity among the strength of the environments of the fields. The fields that have groups (a star at the position of the NFW halo, with group members shown as diamonds) tend to have more galaxies with a high $\Delta_3 x$. There is no a single universal number of galaxies that are important. Each field must be considered on an individual basis.
