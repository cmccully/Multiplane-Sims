When accounting for the environment, our 3-D Lens models produce results that do not have significant bias and have less scatter than models that fit with a Lens+Shear. The Lens+Shear models also overpredict the Hubble Constant and the Einstein radius of the main lens galaxy; these quantities need to be corrected using some other constraint on the external convergence. Our LOS framework does not produce the biases seen here because we explicitly include the convergence in the mass models.
