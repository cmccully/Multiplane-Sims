In Section \ref{sec:3DMassModels} we describe how the 3-D mass models are constructed and review the multi-plane lensing formalism derived in M14, adding the capability to include voids in the lens models (Section \ref{sec:Voids}). In Section \ref{sec:Individual} we discuss which individual galaxies produce the largest LOS/environment effects. We then examine the recovered parameters from realistic 3-D mass models and compare to fits with only an external shear in Section \ref{sec:reallos}. Based on these results, we compare the LOS effects between environments in Section \ref{sec:Environments} and finish by showing that certain lensed image configurations produce stronger constraints on the Hubble constant in Section \ref{sec:Images}.
