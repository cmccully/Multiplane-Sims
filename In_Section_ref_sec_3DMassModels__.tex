In Section \ref{sec:3DMassModels} we describe how the 3-D mass models are constructed and review the multi-plane lensing formalism derived in M14, adding the capability to include voids in the lens models (Section \ref{sec:Voids}). In Section \ref{sec:Individual} we discuss which individual galaxies produce the largest LOS/environment effects.
