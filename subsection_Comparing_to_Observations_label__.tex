Now that we have established some of the qualitative trends about our LOS framework, we turn to a more direct comparison the real RXJ1131 system. \citet{Suyu13} find the best fit parameters of RXJ1131 to be $b = 1.64$'', $\eta = 1.05$, $e = 0.237$, and $\theta_e = 115.8^{\circ}$. We generate mock data for this configuration and then perform a similar MCMC analysis as above. For this analysis, we treat all perturbers using the shear approximation.
