 This is a second order differential equation, so we require two boundary conditions. The first is that $\betahat_ {i i} = 0$. The second condition is based on the first derivative with 
 \begin{equation}
 \left. \frac{d \betahat_{i j}}{d X_j} \right|_{j \rightarrow i} = \frac{D_s}{D_i D_{i s}}.
 \end{equation}
