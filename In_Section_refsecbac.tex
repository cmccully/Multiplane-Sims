In Section \ref{sec:background}, we show the lens equation for a single perturbing galaxy, review our environment/LOS framework, derive analytic expectations for the contribution of higher order terms which we will use as to rank order which galaxies have the most important LOS/environment effects, and derive corrections for the empty space through our lensing beams. In Section \ref{sec:setup}, we outline the setup of the simulations used for this work to test our expectations for the higher order terms, and then apply the framework to a set of toy models that include only a single perturbing galaxy in Section \ref{sec:toy}. We then model more realistic, and therefore more complicated, mass models in Section \ref{sec:reallos} to calibrate our framework given typical observational uncertainties. We end by examining properties of main lens galaxies that make the systems more or less sensitive to environment/LOS effects.
