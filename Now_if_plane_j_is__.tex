Now if plane $j$ is a shear plane (one that includes a galaxy), we write the shear tensor as $\GammaMat_j + \Delta \kappa_j \I$. Then,
\begin{equation}
\C_{i \, j +1} = \betahat_{i j}  - \betahat_{j \, j+1} \GammaMat_j \C_{i j},
\end{equation}
noting that we have used $\beta_{k \, k+1} = \betahat_{k\, k+1}$ to derive this result.
