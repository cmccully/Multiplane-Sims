Intuitively, we expect that galaxies that are close in projection to the main lens will create the largest perturbations in the lensing observables. To turn this intuition into a quantitative statement, we examine the lensing potential of a perturbing galaxy in the environment. We will focus on the simplest case with one main lens galaxy and one perturbing LOS galaxy. We denote the deflection due to the main galaxy as $\al_{g}$ and the deflection due to the perturber as $\al_p$. It is useful to define the lensing potential as
