The Shear models perform better than the None models, but do not perform as well as our LOS models. In all of the parameters except $\chi^2$, the Shear models have a larger bias and scatter in the recovered parameters than the LOS models. This can be a problem: if the $\chi^2$ is low, it might appear that the fit is good, but the fitted parameters are not actually correct. Like the toy models in Section \ref{sec:toy}, the ellipticity has a large scatter likely due the model using it to try account for the perturbing galaxies.
