The Shear models perform better than the None models, but do not perform as well as our LOS models. In all of the parameters, the Shear models have a larger bias and scatter in the recovered parameters than the LOS models. Like the toy models in Section \ref{sec:toy}, the ellipticity has a large scatter likely due the model using it to try account for the perturbing galaxies.
