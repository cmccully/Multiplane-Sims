\begin{equation}
\sF^{ijk} \equiv  \left. \frac{\partial^3 \phi_p}{\partial x^i \partial x^j \partial x^k} \right|_{x=0}.
\end{equation}
Note that we have have adopted the Einstein sum notation, summing over repeated indices. Comparing terms to our expansion above, for a point mass,
$\Gamma \propto \frac{R_p^2}{r^2}$ and $\sF \propto \frac{R_p^2}{r^3}$. Therefore, closer galaxies produce larger shear and flexion terms leading to a stronger LOS/environment effects. For a point mass (a reasonable approximation), the shear goes as $r^{-2}$ and the flexion goes as $r^{-3}$.
