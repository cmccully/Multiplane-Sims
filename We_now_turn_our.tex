We now turn our attention to higher order terms, specifically the third order terms, $\sF$. We expect the errors introduced by higher terms to be dominated by the third order terms (as they are the next terms in the Taylor series expansion), so we can use the strength of the third order terms to rank the importance of perturbers. We now make some plausible assumptions about the lens profiles for both the main lens galaxy and the perturbing galaxy. For the main lens galaxy, we assume a singular isothermal sphere (SIS). The deflection is equal to the Einstein radius of the main lens:
