Our main goal for this work was to test the scatter and bias introduced by different treatments of the environment. We have found that our LOS framework produces the unbiased results, but there is also uncertainty in generating the environment mass models that is only briefly discussed here. This source of uncertainty will be explored in a forthcoming paper (Wong et al.,~in prep.).
