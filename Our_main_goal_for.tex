Our main goal for this work was to test the scatter and bias introduced by different treatments of the environment. We have found that our LOS framework produces the best results, but there is also uncertainty in generating the environment mass models that is not included here. This source of noise will be explored in a forthcoming paper (Wong et al.,~in prep.).
