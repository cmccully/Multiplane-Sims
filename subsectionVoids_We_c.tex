\subsection{Including Empty Space}
In traditional single plane lensing, it reasonable to approximate that the lens galaxy lies on top of a smooth background and that the lens galaxy does not significantly contribute to the overall geometry of the universe. However, as we begin to include more and more galaxies along the line sight, the cosmological effects become non-negligible. In the limit that our mass models are $\sim100\%$ complete, there is no longer any smooth mass background that sets $\Omega_M$ and in turn the geometry of the universe. In this case, if we assume a value for $\Omega_M$ that implicitly sets the mean density of the universe to be non-zero, our answers will be biased because we are only adding mass and not subtracting it from the smooth background mass component.
