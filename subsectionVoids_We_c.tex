\subsection{Including Empty Space}
In traditional single plane lensing, it reasonable to approximate that the lens galaxy lies on top of a smooth background and that the lens galaxy does not significantly contribute to the overall geometry of the universe. However, as we begin to include more and more galaxies along the line sight, the cosmological effects become non-negligible.
