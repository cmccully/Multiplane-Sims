A histogram of $\Delta_3 x$ for RXJ1131 is shown in Figure \ref{fig:d3xhist}. Foreground perturbers and group members tend to have a larger $\Delta_3 x$ than background perturbing galaxies.The perturbations due to higher order terms typically range from $\sim 5 \times 10^{-3}$ arcseconds to $<10^{-10}$ arcseconds.
