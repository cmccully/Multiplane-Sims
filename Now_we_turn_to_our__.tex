Now we turn to our LOS framework. The general expression for the $\C$ matrix between redshifts $z_i$ and $z_j$ is given in equation \ref{eqn:cmatdef} (note the following arguments also apply to the $\B$ matrix). The sum in this equation includes both shear and void planes. Our goal is to rewrite these matrices such that the sums are only over shear planes and the void planes, i.e. the smooth mass component, can be written in terms of a continuous integral.
