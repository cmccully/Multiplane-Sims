We choose source positions from a magnification weighted distribution. This is a reasonable approximation of the magnification bias that is present in real observations \citep[see][]{Keeton04}. We integrate over the azimuthal position of the perturbing galaxy and the source positions as nuisance parameters. We use a sample of 300 quad and 300 double mock image configurations for each mass model.
