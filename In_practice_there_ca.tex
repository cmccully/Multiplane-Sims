In practice, there can be several hundred galaxies projected within $\sim5$ arcminutes of the main lens galaxy. We could use the full multi-plane lensing formalism \citep{PLW}, but the multi-plane lens equation is recursive, making this approach computationally infeasible.
In our previous paper (\citealt{McCully14}, hereafter M14), we derive a new hybrid analytic framework to model the mass in the environment/LOS (see \citealt{Schneider14} for an alternate derivation). Our framework includes non-linear redshift effects, but is also computationally efficient because we employ the tidal approximation for most of the LOS galaxies.
