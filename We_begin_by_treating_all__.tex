We begin by treating all perturbing galaxies using the shear approximation. We show the results of the MCMC models for our LOS framework in figure \ref{fig:los_triangle}. Our LOS models show no bias in any of the parameters, but there are strong correlations between the ellipticity and power law index. These parameters are in turn correlated with the recovered Hubble constant.
