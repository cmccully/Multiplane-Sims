We can follow a similar set of arguments for the time delays and the $\G_{i j}$ matrices. As before, if there are only void planes between $z_i$ and $z_j$, we can define $\G_{i j} = \tauhat_{i j} \I$. This implies that $\tauhat_{i j}$ should follow the following relation:
\begin{equation}
\tauhat_{i j} = \tau_{i s} - \sum\limits_{k = i + 1}^{j - 1}\betahat_{i k} \tau_{k s} \Delta \kappa_k.
\end{equation}
