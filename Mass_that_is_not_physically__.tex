We now turn our attention to galaxies along the LOS. Mass that is not physically associated with lens galaxy, but is close in projection along the LOS, can also produce perturbations to the lens potential \citep[e.g.,][]{Bar-Kana96,Momcheva06, Wong11}. 
\citet{Jaroszynski14} show that omitting the effects of LOS and neighbor galaxies can lead to unsuccessful fits for a substantial number of their simulations. When time delay constraints are included, the fits are more likely to fail.
