While these single perturber MC simulations are only toy models, we can still learn valuable lessons. The non-linear effects due to LOS structures are different between foreground and background perturbers. Background perturbers can in general be described by an external shear, whereas foreground perturbers cannot. The residuals due to higher order terms go as $M / r^3$ for a point mass perturber in the lens plane, which generalizes into $\Delta_3 x$. We now use this $\Delta_3x$ parameter to characterize contributions to the LOS effects from realistic mass models that include $\sim 300$ galaxies. Simulations are the most natural tool to study these complex models, as a analytic solutions are impractical for such complicated mass models.
