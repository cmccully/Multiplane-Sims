\subsection{Fiducial Results}
The toy models described above are useful to isolate and understand the effects of a single perturber. However, in reality lenses rarely have only one perturber. We need to employ more realistic lines of sight to quantify environment/LOS effects. One approach would be to choose beams from cosmological simulations \citep[e.g.,][]{Hilbert09, Collett13, Jaroszynski12, Jaroszynski14}. An alternate approach would be to use observations of real lens fields.
