The middle panels of Figure \ref{mockshear} show the scatter in $h$ for models with the higher order terms removed. For the Shear models, the scatter in $h$ is negligible in the background, but can be tens of percent in the foreground. In the None models that ignore the perturber, the scatter in $h$ can be biased high by as much as $\sim 35\%$ and follows the ``suspension bridge'' shape, similar to the $\chi^2$.
