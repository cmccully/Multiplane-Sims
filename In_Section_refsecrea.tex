We can now use $\Delta_3 x$ and our realistic environment/LOS models to quantify which galaxies to treat exactly and which to treat using the tidal approximation. If $\Delta_3x$ is small, the perturber is not important and can be treated using the tidal approximation; if $\Delta_3 x$ is large, we must treat the galaxy exactly. In general, these models are too complex to write down analytically, so we need a simple quantity like $\Delta_3 x$ to characterize the strength of a given perturber.
