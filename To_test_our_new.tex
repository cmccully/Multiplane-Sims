For each simulation, we use a fiducial main lens galaxy modeled as singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE). For these tests, we adopt $z_{lens} = 0.3$ and $z_{src} = 2.0$ as lens and source redshifts, respectively. Changing the lens or source redshifts does not change our qualitative results. For these models, we adopt Einstein radius of $R_E = 1''$ and an ellipticity of $e =0.3$, typical observed values.
