We begin by using lensmodel to generate Monte Carlo realizations of lensed image configurations. For each simulation, we use a fiducial main lens galaxy modeled as singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE). We adopt $z_{lens} = 0.3$ and $z_{src} = 2.0$ as lens and source redshifts, respectively. Changing the lens or source redshifts does not change our qualitative results. The only difference comes from the $\beta$ factors in $\Delta_3 x$. We initially use a fiducial main lens galaxy with an Einstein radius of $R_E = 1''$ and an ellipticity of $e =0.3$.
