\begin{equation}
  dV_p = r_a^2\ dr_p\ d\Omega
\end{equation}
Note: this uses the angular diameter distance, $r_a$ because that is the distance that should be associated with the solid angle $d\Omega$.  The corresponding mass is $\rho_p\,dV_p$ where this is the proper density, which scales as $\rho_p = \rho_0 (1+z)^3$.  (Strictly speaking, this is the density contrast, $\rho_p - \bar\rho_p$.)
