Using simulations of realistic models of the environment/LOS, we have shown that even taking many galaxies near the lens into account exactly, ignoring the rest of the environment/LOS introduces bias and scatter into the fitted lens parameters. If we want to do precision cosmology, measuring the Hubble Constant to $1\%$ for example, the environment cannot be ignored.
