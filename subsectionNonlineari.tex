\subsection{Non-linearities in the LOS Framework}
To isolate the effects of non-linearity, we use a second set of MC simulations to generate mock data under the tidal approximation from our LOS framework. We then fit the data either treating the perturber as an external shear (Shear Model) in the lens plane or ignoring it entirely (None Model). Like our first set of simulations, we consider a fixed perturber mass of $10^{12} M_\odot$, varying its position and redshift with respect to the main lens galaxy ($z_{\rm{Lens}} = 0.3$). We also do a sanity check by refitting the mock data with our environment/LOS framework to make sure that we recover our input parameters. In all cases, we do recover our input parameters with a perfect $\chi^2$ to within numerical accuracy.
