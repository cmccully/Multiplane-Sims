\begin{equation}
  d\alpha \ =\ \frac{4GM}{c^2 D_\ell \theta}\ \frac{D_{\ell s}}{D_s}
  \ =\ \frac{4\pi G}{c^2}\ \frac{D_\ell D_{\ell s}}{D_s}\ \theta\ \drho_p\ dr_p
\end{equation}
Note that the first two factors are $\Sigma_{\rm crit}^{-1}$.  We would normally right the deflection for a uniform sheet as $d\alpha = \theta\,d\kappa$, so we can identify the convergence as
