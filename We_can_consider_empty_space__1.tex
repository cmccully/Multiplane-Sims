We can consider empty space (voids) as the sum of negative convergence planes  (mass densities less than the mean density of the universe). We first examine a thin slab that extends from proper distance $r_p$ to $r_p+dr_p$.  The density contrast within this slab is $\drho_p = \rho_p - \bar\rho_p$, where $\rho_p = \rho_0 (1+z)^3$ is the proper density.  We can associate this slab with a plane of convergence $d\kappa$ as
  \begin{equation}
  d\kappa = \frac{\drho_p\,dr_p}{\Sigma_{\rm crit}}
 \end{equation}
