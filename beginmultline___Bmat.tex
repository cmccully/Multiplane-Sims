\begin{equation}
  \B_s = \I - \sum\limits^{N}_{i=2} \kappa_i + \beta_{23} \kappa_2 \kappa_3 + \beta_{23}\beta_{34} \kappa_2 \kappa_3 \kappa_4  +\beta_{34} \kappa_3\kappa_4 +\ldots 
\end{equation}
In the limit of a large number of very thin slabs, the convergence in each plane becomes infinitesimal so we can neglect products of $\kappa$'s and write
