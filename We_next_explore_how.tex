We next explore how changing the ellipticity, $e$, or Einstein radius, $R_E$ of the main lens galaxy affects our results. Figure \ref{ecompare} compares the results for $e=0.1, 0.3, 0.5$. $\chi^2$ decreases as the ellipticity increases, implying that the environment effects are weaker for more elliptical, asymmetric lens galaxies. To lowest order, the environment can be characterized with a quadrapole (the shear approximation). Our results suggest that when the quadrapole due to the  ellipticity  is large, the LOS quadradpole is less important.
