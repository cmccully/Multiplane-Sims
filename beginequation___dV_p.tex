\begin{equation}
  dV_p = r_a^2\ dr_p\ d\Omega
\end{equation}
(Note: the angular diameter distance, $r_a$, appears because we are using an angular area $d\Omega$.)  Now if we think of the angular area as being a small circular aperture with angular radius $\theta$, then $d\Omega = \pi\theta^2$ and we can write the mass in the aperture as
