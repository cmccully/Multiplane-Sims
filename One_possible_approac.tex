One possible approach to using gravitational lensing for precision cosmology is to search for one or a few ``golden lenses'' to use to measure cosmological parameters. One consideration when choosing these lenses needs to be the environment. We find that there is significant diversity in lens LOS/environments, with both the number and strengths of the perturbing galaxies vary from field to field.  We also examine which lens properties affect the sensitivity to the environment/LOS. We find that asymmetric image configurations, e.g. those produced by a highly elliptical main lens galaxies, are less sensitive to the lens profile degeneracy leading to improved constraints on the Hubble constant.
