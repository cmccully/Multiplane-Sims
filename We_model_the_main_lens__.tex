We model the main lens galaxy using a power law potential given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:powerlaw}
\kappa(r, \theta) = \frac{b^{2 - \eta} (1 - e)^ {2 - \eta}}{2 r^{2 - \eta} (1 - 2 e \cos^2(\theta) + e^2\cos^2(\theta))^{1 - \eta / 2}},
\end{equation}
where $e$ is the ellipticity. The Einstein radius is given by $R_E = b \eta^{\eta - 2}$. Our initial models use $\eta = 1$ which corresponds to an isothermal ellipsoid, $R_E = 1.5''$ which is close to the mean of the observed lens distribution \citep{Sonnenfeld13}, and an ellipticity of $e = 0.3$.
