The orientation of the main lens galaxy does not show any bias for any of the models. We chose the position angle of the main lens galaxy uniformly from -$\pi/2$ to $\pi/2$. This implies that both the prior and posterior distributions of the main lens galaxy are unbiased. There is some scatter in the None and Shear models ($\sim 10^\circ$), whereas the LOS framework models only show a scatter of $\sim 1^\circ$.
