The next parameter of the perturber we consider is the halo mass. Figure \ref{masscompare} also shows the $\chi^2$ and scatter in $h$ and the ellipticity for three decades of mass for the None, Shear, and LOS models. For all masses, the power law indices are the same and the normalization of the power law is simply different by a factor of the mass. This follows our expectations as both the shear and flexion terms are $\propto M$. For more general mass models, the third order term in the potential goes as $R_p^2/r^3$ (recall for a point mass $R_p^2 \propto M$) and is what we use in our definition of $\Delta_3 x$.
