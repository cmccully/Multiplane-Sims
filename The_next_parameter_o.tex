Figure \ref{fig:toyr3} also shows the $\chi^2$ and scatter in $h$ and the ellipticity for three decades of mass. For all models, the power law indices do not change for different masses. The normalization of the power law is simply scaled by a factor of the mass. This follows our expectations as both the shear and flexion terms are $\propto M$. For more general mass models, the third order term in the potential goes as $R_p^2/r^3$ (recall for a point mass $R_p^2 \propto M$).
