Figure \ref{fig:toyr3} also shows the $\chi^2$ and scatter in $h$ and the ellipticity for three decades of mass for the Lens-Only, Shear, and LOS/ENV models. For all masses, the power law indices are the same and the normalization of the power law is simply different by a factor of the mass. This follows our expectations as both the shear and flexion terms are $\propto M$. For more general mass models, the third order term in the potential goes as $R_p^2/r^3$ (recall for a point mass $R_p^2 \propto M$).
