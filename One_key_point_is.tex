One key point is that the fitted Einstein radii of the Shear and None models are both $\sim 15\%$ higher than the input value. Taking a few close galaxies fully into account removes some of the bias. This offset in the recovered Einstein radius is due to the cumulative external convergence from all of the perturbing galaxies. Because of the mass sheet degeneracy \citep{Falco85}, convergence is typically not included in the Shear or None models. If the convergence is added, it is typically done in post-processing \citep{Collett13, Suyu10}. Our models explicitly include mass/convergence in the correct (i.e., measured) redshift plane, so our models are insensitive to this effect. Rather than treating shear and convergence separately, we build a self-consistent physical model and then extract the shear and convergence from it. We favor this approach because the shear and convergence both arise from the same underlying mass distribution, i.e., they are not independent.
