As with the Hubble Constant, as $e$ increases, the scatter in the recovered $e$ decreases. As the asymmetry of the lens increases, there a few possibilities. Either the absolute value of the scatter remains unchanged while $e$ increases or the image configurations can only be produced for a smaller range of lens models, leading to stronger constraints on $e$.
