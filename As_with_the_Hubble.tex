As with the Hubble Constant, as $e$ increases, the scatter in the recovered $e$ decreases. As the asymmetry of the lens increases, the image configurations can only be produced for a smaller range of lens models, leading to stronger constraints on $e$. Due to strong correlation between the ellipticity and the power law index in figure \ref{fig:los_triangle}, stronger constraints on the ellipticity lead to stronger constraints on the power law index, reducing the lens profile degeneracy.
