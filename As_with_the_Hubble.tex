As $e$ increases, the scatter in the recovered Hubble constant decreases. The image configurations of very asymmetric lenses can only be produced for a smaller range of lens models, leading to stronger constraints on $e$. Due to the strong correlation between the ellipticity and the power law index in figure \ref{fig:los_triangle}, stronger constraints on the ellipticity lead to stronger constraints on the power law index, reducing the lens profile degeneracy.
