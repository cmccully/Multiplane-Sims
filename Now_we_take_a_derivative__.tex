Now, we take a derivative of equation \ref{eqn:betahatint} with respect to the comoving distance to plane $j$, $X_j$, which yields
\begin{equation}
\frac{d \betahat_{i j}}{d X_j} = \frac{d\beta_{i j}}{d X_j} - \int_{X_i}^{X_j} \betahat(z_i, z) \frac{d \beta(z, z_j)}{d X_j} \frac{d \kappa}{d X} d X.
\end{equation}
Note the second term from differentiating the integral term disappears because $\beta(z_j, z_j) = 0$.
