These updates to the $\C_{i j}$ and $\G{i j}$ give us a straight forward way to include a smooth mass component in our 3-D Lens models, parameterized by the completeness function. Without these corrections, if we were to only add mass on top of the mean density background, we would effectively be double counting the perturbing galaxy mass. Including these corrections removes the bias in the recovered lens parameters of our models, as is shown in \ref{sec:los_vs_shear}.
