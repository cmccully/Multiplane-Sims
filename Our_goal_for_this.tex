Our goal for this work is to quantify effects on lensing when the environment/LOS are ignored and compare different methods that have been used to account for environment/LOS effects. We will focus on two different methods to account for the environment/LOS. The first method treats the magnitude and direction of the external shear as free parameters to be optimized for individual lens systems.
