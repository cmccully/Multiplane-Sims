We find that the importance of LOS/Environment effects varies significantly from field to field. Therefore, we argue that each field needs to be modeled individually. Accounting for the uncertainties in building the mass models, we find that distribution on external convergence is narrower for our 3-D Lens models than from ray tracing through N-body simulations. This translates to a stronger prior on measuring the Hubble constant.
