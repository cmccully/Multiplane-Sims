Once we include a large number of perturbing galaxies in the Shear and None models, they best fit Einstein radius drops below the true value. This is because we do not apply any correction for the empty space (voids) in either of these models. This suggests that leaving out the void correction will produce a bias of $\sim 2\%$.
