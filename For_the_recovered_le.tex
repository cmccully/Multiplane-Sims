For the recovered lens quantities, rather than showing the full distribution, we present the median value of the fitted parameters and estimate the scatter by measuring half of the difference between the $16^{th}$ and $84^{th}$ percentiles. When plotting our results, we show the fractional changes in the fitted parameters to emphasize the variation.
