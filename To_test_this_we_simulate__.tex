To test this, we simulate a $10^{12} M_\odot$ perturbing galaxy at a variety of projected offsets and redshifts. To emphasize the contribution from non-linear effects, in this set of simulations we generate the mock data using our 3-D Lens models rather the full multi-plane lens equation. Figure \ref{fig:frontback} shows that the Lens+Shear models can account for a background perturber (to within numerical precision), but cannot mimic the effects of a foreground LOS galaxy.
